      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
Hello there! My full name is Tryz Daron C. Odasco, but you can call me 
Daron. I was born on October 28, 2003. As a child, I was always curious 
about how things work. I often took apart my robotic toys — sometimes I 
managed to put them back together, but most of the time I ended up 
building something completely new from their parts.

Over time, I also developed an interest in computers and games. 
I’ve always liked being outdoors, and when I got my first motorcycle, 
I rode it every single day for a month. My curiosity didn’t stop there — 
I started learning how motorcycles work, bought some tools, and before 
long I was repairing my own bike, and even helping fix other people’s 
motorcycles too.
